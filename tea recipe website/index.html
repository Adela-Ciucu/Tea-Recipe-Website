            <ol>
                <li>Run the tap a little so the water is nicely aerated, and only boil it once to keep the oxigen level up. Oxigen in water helps flavour!</li>
                <li>Pop a tea bag into your mug (always a big mug).</li>
                <li>Pour the hot water over the tea bag and stir briefly.</li>
                <li>Tea needs time to unlock all its flavours, so give it 3-4 minutes to do its thing. It is a perfect time to a sneaky cookie or daydream about vacantion.</li>
                <li>Before removing the tea bag , gently squish it with a spoon against the side of the mug. Not to much or you'll make it bitter.</li>
                <li>If you want, throw in some milk or sugar or honey or nothing else at all.</li>
                <li>Enjoy!</li>
